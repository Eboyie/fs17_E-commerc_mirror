A simple e-commerce design
Although it does not have much functionality, the idea is perfectly design.
The is a Navbar which house four different links.
Inside the Navbar, there are to icons for contact and shopping cart.
Aside, the navbar, there are multiple sections, header, featured phase, service,form, and footer.
The design is also responsive at three different breakPoint, that is (768px, 992px and 1170px).

There is flex-box and Grid layout system application to all the BreakPoint which makes it very compatible to multiple screen sizes
The Selected properties was very casual because, the motive was to do something different from the normal flow.
